Personal answers to the Advent Of Code challenges

Each year will get a personal Readme to explain what is my year objective (new language, year completion, speed contest, tricky solution first ...)

TODO :

Missing data for 2022 days before day 13
Will try to redo them later

My current template is to init input directly in the code with var input = @""; and reducing it from the IDE
to avoid any uncessary steps.
For files readability I will put in place a template with a file opener & parser (and if I am not too lazy an API loader to auto load the input from AoC API)
