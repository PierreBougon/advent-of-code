# 2022

This year my objective is the full completion of the year
Each day with two parts
All days done during the release day
Speed contest is company internal only (release date for challenges are at midnight UTC-5 not planning on waking up arround that time)

Chosen language is C# which is current my main coding language, probably will try python solving for next years if the objective is completion speed

Currently no premade custom library for Challenges, could be an improvement for common tasks of parsing, and graph traversal
